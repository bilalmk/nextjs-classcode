## Task: Building a Next.js Application with Dynamic Routes

**Create a dynamic routing system:**
*   Set up dynamic routes for country names using the app router in Next.js. Each route will dynamically display details for a specific country based on the URL.

**Create a country listing page:**
*   Build a static page that lists five countries of your choice. Each country name should be clickable, linking to its respective dynamic route (e.g., /country/\[country\_name\]).

**On the dynamic route page, display the following details for the selected country**
*   Name
*   Population
*   Capital

Use a JavaScript object to store the details of the countries you want to display. For each country, you should include the name, population, and capital. When a user visits the dynamic route for a specific country (e.g., / country /canada), the application should search for that country in the object.  

1.  If the country is found in the object, display the countryâ€™s details.
2.  If the country is not found, display a message: "Country not found."

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
