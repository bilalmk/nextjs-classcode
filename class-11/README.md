**Assignment - Tailwind**

**Objective:**  
In this assignment, you'll practice building a responsive user interface by creating a navigation menu and working with breakpoints to handle various screen sizes. This will help you get comfortable with the basics of responsive design, CSS, and Next.js components.


**1. Responsive Menu Bar:**
- Create a responsive menu bar for your application.
- The menu should display as a regular horizontal navigation bar on large devices (e.g., desktops).
- On smaller devices (e.g., mobile phones), the menu should transform into a "burger menu" that users can click to expand.

**2. Medium Devices Layout Extension:**
- Extend the provided code, which is already responsive for small and large devices.
- Add styling to handle the medium breakpoint (e.g., tablets).
- On medium devices:
  - The first div should stretch to take the full width of the row.
  - The remaining two divs should move to the second row, each occupying half of the screen.

**Hints:**
- Use CSS classes and media queries to manage the different layouts for small, medium, and large devices.
- Test your work by resizing the browser or using the developer tools to make sure everything looks good across different screen sizes.

Good luck, and have fun with it! This project will help you gain the foundational skills needed for building responsive and user-friendly web applications.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
